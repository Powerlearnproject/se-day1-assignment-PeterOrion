# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a discipline that applies engineering principles to create, design, test, deploy, and maintain software systems. 
Importance in the Technology Industry
Ensures Software Reliability & Quality – Software engineering practices help create robust applications that run correctly and efficiently.
Scalability & Maintainability – Well-engineered software can be updated and built upon without frustration, meaning that it is capable of being utilized for extended spans of time.
Cost & Time Efficiency – Following standard methodologies like Agile or DevOps keeps costs low and quickly delivers the product.
Security & Risk Management – Security features are put in place to protect software from vulnerabilities and web attacks.
Drives Innovation – From machine learning to cloud computing, software engineering propels the revolution in innovation.
Enhances User Experience – Well-designed software optimizes usability, performance, and accessibility for end users.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
